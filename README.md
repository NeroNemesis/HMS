# HMS
Hospital Management System (HMS) will consist in three main sub-systems:
a Patient Management System (PMS), a Medical-Supply Management System (MMS) and a
Ward Staffing Management System (SMS). The three sub-systems are functionally independent.
This would allow added functionalities such as balancing staffing needs with wards occupancy.
